Unlocks the World Shaper ascension perk for Hive Minds (biological Gestalt Consciousnesses). Hive Minds can now terraform worlds into Gaia Worlds!

Inspired by the Gaia group consciousness and Galaxia option from Isaac Asimov's last Foundation books, Foundation's Edge & Foundation and Earth. Also it seemed kind of silly that a Hive Mind could choose the life-seeded origin option and thus start on a Gaia world, but never again terraform another one!

Should be compatible with any other mods that do not touch the World Shaper ascension perk, including mods that add other ascension perks; e.g., I tested this with Expanded Stellaris Traditions and it worked.
