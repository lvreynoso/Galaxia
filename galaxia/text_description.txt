Unlocks the World Shaper ascension perk for Hive Minds (biological Gestalt Consciousnesses).  Inspired by the Gaia group consciousness and Galaxia option from Isaac Asimov's last Foundation trilogy, beginning with Foundation's Edge.

Also it seemed kind of silly that a Hive Mind could choose the life-seeded origin option and thus start on a Gaia world, but never again terraform another one!
